# CSS transformation

#### learning point
1. use transform property and its value translate(x, y)
2. x and y can be presented in differenrt measurements
3. other values of transform include rotate, matrix, skew, scale and perspective

#### checked point
1. transform move or change the appearce of an element, and transition makes an element gradually and smoothly change from one state to another
2. transform can be property for an element, or be a value from transition (transition: transform;)
3. shorthand syntax: div{transition: [property] [duration] [timing-function] [delay];}
4. shorthand syntax: div{animation: [name] [duration] [animation-timing-function] [animation-delay] [animation-iteration-count] [animation-direction] [animation-fill-mode] [animation-play-state]}

#### unsolved
1. challenge2 and challenge3, when should i use "from to", and when should not???
2. what's difference between challenge3 and solution3? why meine didn't work??
